Context

The predictors of in-hospital mortality for intensive care units (ICU)-admitted HF patients remain poorly characterized. We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality among ICU-admitted HF patients.

Using Structured Query Language queries (PostgreSQL, version 9.6), demographic characteristics, vital signs, and laboratory values data were extracted from the following tables in the MIMIC III dataset: ADMISSIONS, PATIENTS, ICUSTAYS, D_ICD DIAGNOSIS, DIAGNOSIS_ICD, LABEVENTS, D_LABIEVENTS, CHARTEVENTS, D_ITEMS, NOTEEVENTS, and OUTPUTEVENTS. Based on previous studies 7-9 13-15, clinical relevance, and general availability at the time of presentation, we extracted the following data: demographic characteristics (age at the time of hospital admission, sex, ethnicity, weight, and height); vital signs (heart rate, (HR), systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], mean blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, saturation pulse oxygen [SPO2], urine output [first 24 h]); comorbidities (hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, depression, hypoferric anemia, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]); and laboratory variables (hematocrit, red blood cells, mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH], mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC], mean corpuscular volume [MCV], red blood cell distribution width [RDW], platelet count, white blood cells, neutrophils, basophils, lymphocytes, prothrombin time [PT], international normalized ratio [INR], NT-proBNP, creatine kinase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen [BUN] glucose, potassium, sodium, calcium, chloride, magnesium, the anion gap, bicarbonate, lactate, hydrogen ion concentration [pH], partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood, and LVEF), using Structured Query Language (SQL) with PostgreSQL (version 9.6). Demographic characteristics and vital signs extracted were recorded during the Ô¨Årst 24 hours of each admission and laboratory variables were measured during the entire ICU stay. Comorbidities were identified using ICD-9 codes. For variable data with multiple measurements, the calculated mean value was included for analysis. The primary outcome of the study was in-hospital mortality, defined as the vital status at the time of hospital discharge in survivors and non-survivors.
